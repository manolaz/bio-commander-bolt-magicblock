# Bio Commander: Corpus Humanus

## Core Concept

**Bio Commander** now takes place in an expanding biological frontier - open space divided into interconnected 16x16 zones representing different tissue regions, organ systems, or even entire organisms.

## Zone-Based World Structure

**Initial Setup**:
- Start with 1-3 core zones (e.g., bloodstream, lymph node, infected tissue)
- Each zone is a 16x16 grid (256 cells total)
- Zones connect at designated border cells

**Dynamic Zone Expansion**:
- **Infection Spread**: New zones auto-generate when pathogens reach zone edges
- **Immune Response**: Players can establish new zones as "staging areas"
- **Organ Systems**: Unlock specialized zones (liver detox zone, lung gas exchange, etc.)
- **Metastasis**: Cancer-type pathogens can create distant zones

## Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics

**Zone Types**:
- **Circulatory Zones**: Fast movement, global immune cell deployment
- **Tissue Zones**: Dense defensive positions, slower movement
- **Lymphatic Zones**: Immune cell production and coordination hubs
- **Barrier Zones**: Skin, mucus membranes with special defensive rules
- **Organ Zones**: Unique win conditions and special abilities

**Inter-Zone Movement**:
- Immune cells can travel between connected zones
- Pathogens spread through blood/lymph connections
- Some cells specialize in "zone jumping" (circulating immune cells)
- Border control becomes strategic chokepoints

## Strategic Elements

**Territory Control**:
- Control percentage of zone grants resource bonuses
- Multiple small infections vs concentrated large ones
- Zone-specific victory conditions

**Resource Management**:
- **Energy**: Maintain immune cell operations across zones
- **Antibodies**: Deploy zone-wide defensive measures  
- **Stem Cells**: Produce new immune cells in bone marrow zones
- **Nutrients**: Fuel cellular activities, can be depleted

**Command Structure**:
- **Local Commanders**: Control individual zones
- **System-Wide Coordination**: Cross-zone strategies
- **Specialized Units**: Cells that excel in specific zone types

## Expansion Mechanics

**Automatic Expansion Triggers**:
- Pathogen breakthrough at zone borders
- Immune system "scouting" new areas
- Systemic infections requiring new fronts
- Player-initiated expansion for strategic advantage

**Zone Customization**:
- Environmental hazards (toxins, radiation, extreme pH)
- Beneficial symbiotic organisms
- Scar tissue from previous battles
- Age-related changes affecting zone properties

This creates a living, breathing biological world where the battlefield constantly evolves, requiring both tactical zone control and strategic macro-management across the expanding biological landscape!
